#### Cost-effective communication and control architectures for active low voltage grids

#### Mikel armendariz (PhD Thesis)

- [] The current grid modernization also leads to an enhancement of the corresponding communication and control architectures in order to guarantee the necessary quality of service performance.
- [] The grid is becoming more decentralized by hosting an increasing number of distributed and variable small-scale generation resources such as domestic roof-top photovoltaic systems, heat-pumps, electric vehicles (EV)
- [] The enhancement of these architectures consists of deploying sensors and actuators in the grid for improved observability and controllability. 
- [] Feed-in Tariffs - A well established policy to accelerate the renewable energy deployment into the grid. This is performed by offering long-term contracts to PV producers to sell their electricity to the market under a fixed/premium 
based tariff above the market rate. 
- [] Power quality performance indicators for ALV distribution grids:
	- voltage magnitude variations
	- Power service interruptions
	
- [] The MV/LV secondary substations use diffirent architectures while integrating ICT for real-time control:
	- Centralized architecture
	- Coordinated architecture 
	- Distributed architecture 
- [] In grid reconfiguration, the typical grid constraints application that can be addressed by grid reconfiguration are:
	- loss minimization
	- load balancing
	- service restoration
	- reliability improvement
