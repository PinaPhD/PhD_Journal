10th Jan 2022
- Totally confused, I don't even know where to start. I arrive in NL on 30th December 2021 and I am yet to find a house to live in. 

- **Y'all**: So where are you staying now? In the streets? 
- **Me**: uuumh.... Well I found an amazing lady called Gladys and she is hosting me for the time being while I scout for housing.
