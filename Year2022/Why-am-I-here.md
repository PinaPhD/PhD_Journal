### Why am I here

**This is a reflective essay detailing the reasoning behind starting my PhD as an early stage researcher in the InnoCyPES project under the EU Innovative Training Network**
In year 2019, when I joined CMU Africa, our English instructor, Lucy-Anna Kelly, introduced us to the reflective essay "why am I here". While writing, one goes through a soul searching 
moment to discover the reasons why they made a certain career move, a change in course, joined academia as a researcher and many more life decisions. At the beginning of 2022, I moved to 
The Netherlands to commence a new chapter in my academic life as a Marie Sk≈Çodowska-Curie PhD Fellow. This was everything I ever hoped for in a PhD program. The PhD program would not only
require me to undertake research in the domain of IoT for renewable energy, with a key focus on off-shore wind power production and transmission to the mainland but also provide massive 
opportunity for me to attend training schools in different regions of Northern and Western Europe, as well as periods of secondment with our industrial partners in Denmark and France. 

While applying, I looked at the InnoCyPES ESR1 project details and evaluated my skills in the research and application domain.As usual, one possibly does not fit the whole description but
I checked most of the boxes and that to me was enough to make the application on 16th June 2021. I waited for a response from the team from 16th June to the 17th of September 2021 when I got 
to do my first PhD presentation interview. I emerged their most promising candidate from a shortlist of 7 candidates that made it to the final round and when I got the 4-year PhD offer and 
made plans to leave Kigali, Rwanda for The Netherlands in late December 2021. 

**Why am I here?**
- [ ] To learn how to do research for the renewable energy sector. I have a background in telecommunications, IoT and embedded systems development. My professional and academic background in these
areas will come in handy while studying *IoT network design and reliability evaluation for the renewable energy sector* which will be my project for the next three years. I am here to interact with 
senior scientist, professors, industrial R&D personnel, to learn how to write white papers, collect and analyse critical data, perform simulations on industrial scale software or simulation platforms,
and to attend trainings on how to do better research and to learn more about the renewable energy sector. 
- [ ] To interact with people from different races, cultures and religions. Having lived in Kigali, Rwanda for almost 3 years, I got to interact with people from all over Africa and it was interesting to 
see how we are all connected despite our differences. Joining this project, I am able to interact with people with different social and academic backgrounds. I will get an opportunity to learn from them
in different capacities as well as share my innovative, novel ideas with them (possibly through the different dissemination platforms available for us in this project üëç)
- [ ] To live in a different continent. I have clocked several decades in Africa and would like to see the world from a whole different perspective. The Netherlands is ranked as the fourth wealthiest country where people tend to be modest and their children, the happiest. Living among such people would be quite an adventure as their modesty and approach to life resounds with what I always envision
for my future self. 

This is going to be one of the most important decades of my life. 
Now, I know most of you are already on the question: 

*so, what next after your PhD?* 
That lingers in my mind and it is something to think about at the beginning as it forms part of the research direction 
process. After my PhD, I would want to work with one of our industrial partners in their R&D department and a few years later, join a 2-year fellowship that will give me the opportunity to use my research skills
and academic background in the European and African region. 

*So, no family goals?*
I'd like to marry late in life, for companionship purposes, if that is the direction my life would take. However, I feel content in my current state and I enjoy taking care and being with my parents and sister.
